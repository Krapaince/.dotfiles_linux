#  Linux dotfiles

This repository aims to store my (arch) linux dotfiles. Those are managed by
[dotdrop](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io).

Look, copy and steal any bit of config that you want! (I might have myself
stolen some bits from yours anyway).

The `dotdrop` folder contains config file for dotdrop.
The `dotfiles` folder contains dotfiles.
The `packages` folder contains files which contain packages that I need when I
redump (maybe some day I will switch to nixOS).

## Installation

[Dotdrop](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io) is required to install dotfiles.

The config installation can then be done with one command at the repository
root:
```
dotdrop install -p Krapaince-arch -D -c dotdrop/config.yaml
```
